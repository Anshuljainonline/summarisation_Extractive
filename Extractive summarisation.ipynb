       "' WARNING AGAIN....BURGUNDY COLOR RUNS...WASH OUT BY HAND AS IT WILL TAKE MANY, MANY WASHES TO GET THE RED OUT!NOT WORTH IT!!Have been a big fan of Zwipes for some time.Am on my second bulk package of Zwipes regular microfiber cloths in pastel colors.  Purchased them at Amazon...48 Zwipes for under $23!Price and color wise this is the way to go.These burgundy waffle weave Zwipes are targeted for stemware.  They did a fine job on glassware, mirrors and computer screens in our home.I also find the regular Zwipe to be just as effective, especially when new.When I purchase any Zwipes, I designate half the colors for water and windex cleaning, and the other half for polishing with waxes etc.Machine wash with no fabric softener and you are cleaning well and saving the environment. These microfiber stemware and bar towels do just as they promise, drying glassware and silverware and other dishes to a shine with little effort.  They also shine my black granite countertop to a mirror-like finish.  The charcoal color is pretty and practical, too! Nice to have around the house. Smaller than a dish towel, bigger than a wash cloth, just the right size and absorbency for cleaning counter tops and picking up spills. Nice to have a bunch of them available for such chores. However, the burgundy ones I got bleed like crazy. I thought after the first wash, which turned some white fabric pink, it would have washed out, but it didn\\'t. I hand washed them in a sink 5 times in hot water and detergent and each time it looked like I poured a bottle of wine in the bowl. Since I will be using these around my house, I\\'m sure they are going to end up in a wash and I hate \"pink\" whites. So, I tried bleaching them white, but the color would not go away and they still bleed! So, you may want to think twice about the burgundy colored ones. If you are using them in a bar, maybe this won\\'t be an issue. The first thing I want to say is to NOT wash these with ANYTHING you do NOT want to have tinted.Personally why they would pick a color like this is beyond me...but they did, I wish all of these kindsof products where white...that way you do not have an issue with dyes fading. I washed these witha pile of other towels both micro fiber and regular terry towels, that are my &#34;rag towels&#34; that I useto dry my car, dry windows when washing them, etc. I am SO HAPPY I did this...as it was severalof the old rag towels got a bit of new color added to them...lol  So I put all of these through just arinse with white vinegar, hopefully that will be a help. The drying capabilities of the towel is fine, tome they are good for basic house cleaning and that\\'s what I will use them for, and for cleaning mycar, etc. They need a better quality dye if they are going to offer these in colors though. I like these bar towels, but they aren\\'t my very favorite.  I\\'ve been using theTowels by Doctor Joe Blue 16\" x 25\" New Surgical Huck Towel, Pack of 12for over three years.  I\\'ve gone back and bought more packs of those Doctor Joe towels a couple of times, so I\\'m definitely a devoted customer.  For about $7 less, you get twice as many of the other brand (12 towels for about a buck apiece) as opposed to closer to $20 for six towels (prices change though, so check for yourself).First a weird question:  Why are these \"stemware and bar towels\" listed in the Automotive section?I guess that the answer is that these are pretty much high grade shop rags.  Granted they\\'re nicer than shop rages, but not by much.I like the maroon color of these towels.  They look good in a bar setting and they\\'re good for wiping up drips of wine (especially red wines) and colored mixers like colas and ginger ales.One other issue is that these aren\\'t as soft and lint-free as similar towels.  I wouldn\\'t use these to clean my car or to wipe my eye glasses.I like these towels.  I like having bar towels when I entertain.  If I hadn\\'t used the other brand before, I\\'d probably be more tolerant of these.  I\\'ll stick with the Doctor Joe towels at home.  These Zwipes...I\\'ll take them to my office for when we have potlucks and birthday bashes. These towels may not seem that great, but to me they are awesome. I use them to clean my appliances and windows because they DON\\'T leave streaks! Now I can use these towels instead of going through tons of paper towels which get very expensive. When I\\'m done cleaning with these towels, I just pop them in the washing machine on gentle cycle, and they are ready to go all over again. I have also used them to try dishes, and glasses, and they don\\'t streak my glasses either. I like these towels, because they do what they are meant to do. These are fantastic kitchen towels. Lightweight, takes up less space in a drawer than cotton towels. Because they are microfiber they wear like iron and sterilize with one washing without soaking. Six towels might just be enough to last a life time. Note: Amazon has combined the reviews for all the different colors of this product. The colored versions have lower ratings, especially the Burgundy one which has many reports that it bleeds badly. I have the white ones. Amazon also lists this product under &#34;Automotive&#34;, which may also bear on the reviews.This is a very thin towel, but turns out to be very absorbent. For 1-3 person-days of dishes that had been given time to drain/air-dry on a rack, a single towel easily handled removing the remaining water, and did so with a single pass of the towel, and seemed that it could have handled more. Being thin may be an advantage because the towel more easily conforms to the contours of the dish, glass or utensil being dried. And they are easier to wring out. They *might* also air-dry more quickly, but I didn\\'t do that experiment -- my climate and usage pattern allows these and my other dish towels enough time to air-dry.For those who care about such things (I don\\'t, but know people who do), this towel is smaller than (my) traditional dish towels. The towels came with some loose threads along the edges and there were a few more after washing--enough to notice, but not enough to impair functionality.-- Douglas B. Moran These microfiber towels are a bit thin. The waffle design gives them more surface area and they do a good job of drying and buffing a car. I just wish they were a little bit thicker and I think that would make them perform a bit better and be a little easier to handle. Otherwise these are good towels and they work well, especially for buffing off wax. These towels are very useful.You can use them for spills and many other things.Im using them for dish cloths.They do a good job  scrubbing off the stuck on stuff.You get six per box and each of them are individually wrapped in plastic.The material is a bit flimsy but they should last awhile.Another reviewer mentioned that the color runs but it wasn\\'t that bad and it mostly came off when I washed dishes.At about two bucks each they aren\\'t priced to high for what they are. These waffle textured microfiber towels are perfect for lint free drying of crystal and glassware.  The waffles grab water that the towel quickly absorbs.  The shape is the traditional 12&#34; x 25&#34; rectangle and the towels fit nicely on my over the cabinet towel bar.Although they\\'re marketed as stemware and bar towels, they\\'re also great dust cloths, and clean a TV screen in seconds.Since these are nylon and polyester, you can\\'t use chlorine bleach when washing them, but the synthetic blend means they won\\'t stain the way cotton cloths do.  It also means they\\'ll dry very quickly.Still, These are an admirable addition to the household/kitchen towel arsenal. This set of Zwipes is the perfect size for throwing over my shoulder while working on whatevers.  (Whatevers is that catch all descriptor for \\'if you got a job to do that might be messy then use one of these jewels\\')  For example, yesterday, I was slicing a prime rib roast and thank goodness I had one of these on my shoulder.  I am not what one might call a neat freak and it was proven when I had not prepared the cutting surface properly and the au Jux decided to flow.  Not for long or much.  I hit the streak of juice with my Zwipe and as expected the mess was absorbed with ease and I had no mess to concern myself with.Six to a pack works well for my use and each acts like a sponge that can be rinsed out and reused before machine washing all the microfiber cloths together.  I already have one in the front seat of those occasions requiring a little bit of clean up or wiping the inside windows.  With an 80/20% ratio of polyester to nylon, I expect a long life from the set.  If that statement proves wrong, I will return with an update.I highly recommend these towels along with the other user. These are good looking towels, but do not feel soft and are not particularly absorbent.  I prefer the 100% cotton towels.  The edges are well finished with nice seams.  These are plain white with a textured waffle pattern, but no colors. I\\'m not sure why these are in the automotive section, but they\\'re useful for the kitchen as well as for cleaning.They\\'re slightly smaller than a regular kitchen towel but work well as a hand towel. I\\'ve also used them to clean glass and TV and computer monitors.I like the charcoal (almost black) color and find them attractive. Knowing that red items might bleed, I decided to put the towels in a sink-full of water to see what happened. Oh, my gosh, these towels faded badly. I left them soak a while, wrung them out, added more hot water & let them soak again...they faded more. I repeated this process one more time, then wrung the towels out & let them dry. I decided to handwash a couple of them, so I soaped them up & ran hot water on them. I couldn\\'t believe that the water was even redder than before. I\\'m wondering if they\\'ll ever stop fading.The two I handwashed were used for general house cleaning. They did a good job dusting, absorbing water & keeping surfaces lint free. I will dedicate some for glassware use but might bleach them to hopefully stop the color bleed.Because of their waffle weave texture, the towels measure about 1/2\" shorter all the way around than advertised.  They can be stretched to the advertised size.Zwipes Waffle Weave towels perform like microfiber should, but I cannot recommend the burgundy color. This is an excellent lint free towel that\\'s perfect for a multitude of tedious areas.Thin and manageable ~ yet super absorbent, this waffle towel is ideal for fragile and fine glasswareand so much more.I washed up several items in our china cabinet, some delicate old wine glasses, and small cordial liqueur glasses.The towel completely absorbs water instantly with light contact, and leaves a sparkling shine.Their also great for car care. Caught a 50 degree winter day and washed the salt off our car.I used these towels to detail the windows an mirrors, they did a perfect job without leaving lint or streaking ~ on one pass.I must say ~ the more I use these towels ~ the more impressed I am with them.Size is 12\" x 24\" (washed)  Use only non chlorine bleach. I am sort of a towel snob and have many assortments of various towels to perform various tasks.  I have some other microfiber towels with which to compare these to which are much better quality.  These are rather thin.  You can hold them up to the light and see through them.Although thinner towels can come in handy sometimes,  these seem a bit flimsy and cheap looking in my opinion,  and they really don\\'t look like they will hold up a long time as there are a lot of strings poking out around the edges where the borders are sewn.They do a pretty good job of drying dishes however I\\'m disappointed in the quality. These aren\\'t as thick as a normal terry towel but they are fairly absorbent. The 12&#34; width is a little less than most of my other kitchen towels.  But they are soft, and the waffle texture gives them some added &#34;oomph&#34; behind your elbow grease.  They do seem to leave a little less lint than a terry towel which is a nice plus.I got the charcoal color and if they bled any when washed, you wouldn\\'t notice it since they looked like a faded black to begin with.  I do like that the dark color won\\'t show any stains but of course, I won\\'t be able to bleach them if they get really yucky.  They were shipped with each pair of towels in a glassine bag, which was nice but a little unnecessary. I ordered these towels thinking we could use them as dish towels instead of the normal cotton ones we\\'ve used for years.  They are very soft and supple in a deep, rich burgundy color.  The 12&#34;x25&#34; size is perfect for a dish towel.  What I really like best is the absorb-ability.  Compared to cotton or cotton blend towels these are much, much more absorbent and they dry very quickly.  I have purchased car window wipes made out of the same type material and they are washing machine friendly.  Highly recommended! They are a little thinner than I was expecting, but they work really well at drying dishes.  I\\'ve also found that they are great for cleaning mirrors and other glass around the house and in the vehicles too.  I\\'ve already washed them several times and so far they are holding up well. I have other Zwipes towels that I bought years ago and they still are in use around the house so hopefully these hold up as well. Some may find them a bit narrow but they absorb a lot and the thing I like most about them is the fact that they\\'re tactile and adhere to the surface they\\'re drying and they stick around to finish the polish as well.  They don\\'t just pass over and require your elbow grease to soak up the suds or the water.  That\\'s a vast improvement over the dish towells I\\'ve been using for forty some odd years!  I highly recommend them. I use these towels to dry individual glasses and dishes that I clean in my sink or that come out of my dishwasher wet. They do a fine job.These seem great for small drying jobs.  They are soft to the touch and seem to embrace what I am drying so there is no water or water marks left.Because of the size (&#8220;12 by 16&#34;) I do not use these if I am drying pots and pans that have been soaking in my sink.  I use a bigger and thicker towel for that.For me these are great when drying glasses and dishes and even my stainless steel tea kettle. The waffle weave microfiber seems designed to work on items that I want to show off and it does a good job drying without leaving any marks. I have used many different kinds and brands of microfiber towels over the years. A lot of them promise great cleaning and no lint but don\\'t deliver on either. The Zwipes get you both. They clean very well - not just glassware but even fingerprint-smeared phone and tablet screens! And lint? None at all.The Zwipes towels are soft and easy to handle - they\\'re a bit smaller than some similar towels I have seen, but I find that makes them easier to use. A word of caution, though - the color bleeds when washing quite a bit at first, so I suggest washing them in the sink the first couple of times. It seems stable after that. Most basically, these are microfiber towels, so there\\'s no much to say. They are small, thing, absorb liquid, etc. I didn\\'t find any features that make them particularly notable. The price is okay for a six pack, but the frayed edges let you know that these are fairly cheaply manufactured.I use these for drying, so it\\'s not like the color rubs off; however, if you soak these, they will bleed into the water. It\\'s best to wash these in the sink if you don\\'t want your laundry to end up vaguely burgundy colored.These towels are fine, but not great. The fact that I have to wash them separately is supremely annoying. I\\'d look elsewhere if you\\'re in the market for a microfiber towel. Think of the Zwipes as a cotton waffle kitchen towel with the benefits of a synthetic towel - no lint, quick drying and fabric longevity among others.The first thing you need to do is wash the towels separately or with dark, similar colors. They bleed a lot! After the initial wash they felt and looked like well-used cotton towels.The waffle weave makes the towels very absorbent and they do not feel like at all like new towels. I was able to wipe dry, without any lint residue 4 of these 21 oz. glasses -Riedel Vinum Bordeaux, Set of 2 (Set of 2). They do feel like soft cotton and I had to check the labels to confirm that they were in fact synthetic - 80% Polyester and 20% Nylon. They do not have any slippery, non-absorbent feel associated with polyester.The towels are thinner and smaller than regular kitchen towels - 12 x 16 versus 18 x 25. I would have preferred a single larger, thicker towel instead of having to use 3 of them to finish up my drying. Flip side is that you get to use a fresh towel every 4 glasses. :o)2 bucks a piece for these towels is worth it..especially if they last like other microfiber cloths. I have some dusting cloths that lasted 7-8 years.Would recommend!Pros:* Used cotton feel after first wash* Waffle weave makes these as absorbent as cotton* Lint free cleaning* Quicker drying than cotton* Great for cleaning/polishing stainless steel appliancesCons:* Smaller size means more towels for even small jobs'"

      " this is smaller then i thought for a funnel yet it is useful more then i thought it would be. such as oil in the lawnmowers. this is a small funnel  it will work for just abought any task.small and easy to store in a zip lock bag to keep it clean. this inexpensive funnel is pretty handy for certain jobs. i use mine for fuel additives such as seafoam  which is a good product but the container is difficult to pour into most car truck fuel tanks. a nice little funnel for the price. this is absolutely one of the best four and a half bucks i have ever spent. i originally thought i would use it to pour gas into lawn care devices but when it arrived my wife had a need for a funnel to use in the kitchen. she scrubbed it thoroughly and it worked fine for her. in addition  she said it looked like one of the old time hearing aids. amazingly  she was right on target. by holding the small end to my ear i could clearly hear her  the tv and the telephone. to my utter surprise all sounds are clearly amplified. i never would have believed it if i had not experienced this for myself. there are some frequencies which i have some difficulty in hearing now that i have  matured . my wife's voice is one of them so this is a handy aid when i want to hear something that she does not clearly elucidate. for convenience it even has a loop on the wide end where i can insert a chain or rope to hang around my neck. the uses for this item are nearly endless and i will order another one to serve the original purpoe for which i bought this one which is for pouring gas and oil.this is truly a multi purpose tool and at a bargain price. hard to complain  it is a funnel  it is a good length and width for awkwardly located fills. has a guard on the top for spill prevention  feels sturdy and durable  and the price is more than fair. what's not to like  i got this to change oil on my 2005 honda odyssey and it made the job of changing oil very easy. i was able to get nearly 4 1 2 quarts of oil in a couple of minutes with out any spill. it's also multi purpose  very good value for the money paid. this thing is smaller and skinnier than i thought  although it is very long. it is awkward for filling my car engine oil because its so long that the bottom of the funnel hits the valve heads before anything else  so its unstable to just sit in there. i have to hold it to support it with one hand while i fill the oil with the other.it does have some good uses though  as it is just the right size to fill my motorcycle transmission oil.all in all  the funnel is solid  no complaints on the product quality  but i think next time i will purchase in person so i can really gauge the size i need. ordered several funnels. one for my auto trans oil. one for filling the toyota van anti freeze via the top hose. faster than filling via the radiator cap. one for the shampoo consolidation in the house. works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower it even has a lip on the top so the oil will not go out of the funnel.the only problem with funnels is  you never know how full the chamber is and always need to remove the funnel to look. someone should invent a meter on the funnel  that helps in overflowing and an end valve in case the chamber is full  to prevent it from overflowing.but until then  this funnel will do just fine  it feels like it is made of great quality stuff. it's very sturdy and not flimsy like some other funnels out there. i recommended this funnel in conjunction with this item   34 rhinogear 05068 3 piece funnel set  34 i use this to top off transmission fluid in vehicles. comes in very handy    a dollar  i stole this. hehehee while this is a simply plastic funnel  its uses are allot. my biggest use is with power equipment like my riding lawnmower  the oil cap is near the bottom and a difficult place to fill. the funnel is perfect also for smaller engines like my pressure washer   etc. hope this helps. perfect funnel to pour oil into your crankcase.. this funnel can be used for other purposes of course .. but i bought it for pouring quart oil into my crankcase. i love this funnel more than others that i have because it is the only one that stays in while i am pouring. the long spout keeps it in. i highly recommend it. i use one for automotive and my wife uses one for pouring in the homemade detergent into barrels. i'd previously purchased this w o having an actual use for it. turned out to be practically custom made for putting oil in my subaru inverter generator. what's to say  it's not very large. it works perfect in my 2003 chevy truck to add a fuel additive into the fuel tank    it should work for power steering and transmission also  at least on car trucks that is not hard to get to or down load were access is bad. the design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it  for under  5  not a bad deal. hang it up out of the way when done with it. it's able to fit into your transmission dip stick tube  so it has to be small enough  so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once    it's small and does not hold all that much. for what it is  i like it. this is a great funnel for what it is desinged to do. add fuel additives to your gas tank. no drips or spills on the side of your car.  look at the picture  for other applications  maybe a larger or different style funnel is better. price shipped to your door tax free is very good.   3.36  the list price  23.88 probably should be  3.88    i like it and would buy it again. got this for oil changes on my victory vision. it works well but you do have to poor slow as to not overflow the funnel. it is a good length and offered an easy tool for use with my motorcycle. priced right and just right for the longer reach needed for todays cars and trucks. buy two or 3 they are so handy.makes it easy to fill hard to reach items such as mowers utv's etc. i love this funnel  it has so many uses. for example i can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. i can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until i need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. let's see a hammer do either of those things. my hammer never stays put. you can reason with this funnel  it has an open mind so to speak. others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel. in these cases  when all you need is a cheap plastic funnel it all comes down to price. there are no frills here... you pour things through this into other things... end of story.if that is what you are trying to do  i highly recommend this one i got sick of using my   34 common  34  funnel for different uses  trying to clean up an oily funnel so you can use it for sea foam is just dumb when you can get these for a little more than  1. the size length is perfect for gas tank additives. i purchased 3  i keep one in the garage to pour sea foam into my cara motorcycle snow blower lawnmower. and the other 2 i keep in whatever vehicle i'm currently using  in my   34 just in case  34  pack.great product. great little funnel  long narrow output is good for transmission fluid or other stuff similar with a small opening not easy to get to. this i use to replace the transmission fluid on my lincoln town car. the tube is quite narrow and way back at the firewall. the long skinny tip of this funnel reaches all the way back there and fits well  preventing a real mess. can't beat the price either. bought this along with a no spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. the length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. it also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1  it should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2  the diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size   would allow faster filling. the size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. the funnel is 10  long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6  long. it states that the funnel is 4  x 4  but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2 1 4  in diameter at the widest point.it would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.\n"

       "\"summarize: this is smaller then i thought for a funnel yet it is useful more then i thought it would be. such as oil in the lawnmowers. this is a small funnel  it will work for just abought any task.small and easy to store in a zip lock bag to keep it clean. this inexpensive funnel is pretty handy for certain jobs. i use mine for fuel additives such as seafoam  which is a good product but the container is difficult to pour into most car truck fuel tanks. a nice little funnel for the price. this is absolutely one of the best four and a half bucks i have ever spent. i originally thought i would use it to pour gas into lawn care devices but when it arrived my wife had a need for a funnel to use in the kitchen. she scrubbed it thoroughly and it worked fine for her. in addition  she said it looked like one of the old time hearing aids. amazingly  she was right on target. by holding the small end to my ear i could clearly hear her  the tv and the telephone. to my utter surprise all sounds are clearly amplified. i never would have believed it if i had not experienced this for myself. there are some frequencies which i have some difficulty in hearing now that i have  matured . my wife's voice is one of them so this is a handy aid when i want to hear something that she does not clearly elucidate. for convenience it even has a loop on the wide end where i can insert a chain or rope to hang around my neck. the uses for this item are nearly endless and i will order another one to serve the original purpoe for which i bought this one which is for pouring gas and oil.this is truly a multi purpose tool and at a bargain price. hard to complain  it is a funnel  it is a good length and width for awkwardly located fills. has a guard on the top for spill prevention  feels sturdy and durable  and the price is more than fair. what's not to like  i got this to change oil on my 2005 honda odyssey and it made the job of changing oil very easy. i was able to get nearly 4 1 2 quarts of oil in a couple of minutes with out any spill. it's also multi purpose  very good value for the money paid. this thing is smaller and skinnier than i thought  although it is very long. it is awkward for filling my car engine oil because its so long that the bottom of the funnel hits the valve heads before anything else  so its unstable to just sit in there. i have to hold it to support it with one hand while i fill the oil with the other.it does have some good uses though  as it is just the right size to fill my motorcycle transmission oil.all in all  the funnel is solid  no complaints on the product quality  but i think next time i will purchase in person so i can really gauge the size i need. ordered several funnels. one for my auto trans oil. one for filling the toyota van anti freeze via the top hose. faster than filling via the radiator cap. one for the shampoo consolidation in the house. works great in refilling oil in my generator and lawnmower it even has a lip on the top so the oil will not go out of the funnel.the only problem with funnels is  you never know how full the chamber is and always need to remove the funnel to look. someone should invent a meter on the funnel  that helps in overflowing and an end valve in case the chamber is full  to prevent it from overflowing.but until then  this funnel will do just fine  it feels like it is made of great quality stuff. it's very sturdy and not flimsy like some other funnels out there. i recommended this funnel in conjunction with this item   34 rhinogear 05068 3 piece funnel set  34 i use this to top off transmission fluid in vehicles. comes in very handy    a dollar  i stole this. hehehee while this is a simply plastic funnel  its uses are allot. my biggest use is with power equipment like my riding lawnmower  the oil cap is near the bottom and a difficult place to fill. the funnel is perfect also for smaller engines like my pressure washer   etc. hope this helps. perfect funnel to pour oil into your crankcase.. this funnel can be used for other purposes of course .. but i bought it for pouring quart oil into my crankcase. i love this funnel more than others that i have because it is the only one that stays in while i am pouring. the long spout keeps it in. i highly recommend it. i use one for automotive and my wife uses one for pouring in the homemade detergent into barrels. i'd previously purchased this w o having an actual use for it. turned out to be practically custom made for putting oil in my subaru inverter generator. what's to say  it's not very large. it works perfect in my 2003 chevy truck to add a fuel additive into the fuel tank    it should work for power steering and transmission also  at least on car trucks that is not hard to get to or down load were access is bad. the design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it  for under  5  not a bad deal. hang it up out of the way when done with it. it's able to fit into your transmission dip stick tube  so it has to be small enough  so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once    it's small and does not hold all that much. for what it is  i like it. this is a great funnel for what it is desinged to do. add fuel additives to your gas tank. no drips or spills on the side of your car.  look at the picture  for other applications  maybe a larger or different style funnel is better. price shipped to your door tax free is very good.   3.36  the list price  23.88 probably should be  3.88    i like it and would buy it again. got this for oil changes on my victory vision. it works well but you do have to poor slow as to not overflow the funnel. it is a good length and offered an easy tool for use with my motorcycle. priced right and just right for the longer reach needed for todays cars and trucks. buy two or 3 they are so handy.makes it easy to fill hard to reach items such as mowers utv's etc. i love this funnel  it has so many uses. for example i can pour a liquid into a container with a small opening with great ease. i can hang it on a wall and it will wait there until i need to pour another liquid into a container with a small opening again. let's see a hammer do either of those things. my hammer never stays put. you can reason with this funnel  it has an open mind so to speak. others may try but they all fall short of the splendor that is this funnel. in these cases  when all you need is a cheap plastic funnel it all comes down to price. there are no frills here... you pour things through this into other things... end of story.if that is what you are trying to do  i highly recommend this one i got sick of using my   34 common  34  funnel for different uses  trying to clean up an oily funnel so you can use it for sea foam is just dumb when you can get these for a little more than  1. the size length is perfect for gas tank additives. i purchased 3  i keep one in the garage to pour sea foam into my cara motorcycle snow blower lawnmower. and the other 2 i keep in whatever vehicle i'm currently using  in my   34 just in case  34  pack.great product. great little funnel  long narrow output is good for transmission fluid or other stuff similar with a small opening not easy to get to. this i use to replace the transmission fluid on my lincoln town car. the tube is quite narrow and way back at the firewall. the long skinny tip of this funnel reaches all the way back there and fits well  preventing a real mess. can't beat the price either. bought this along with a no spill 5 gallon can to use for track days. the length is excellent and gets down into the filler of your car. it also fits in a 1 gallon freezer bag so you can seal it up and put it back in the trunk when done without smelling gas or getting it on your trunk carpet. two improvements would make this a 5 star funnel. 1  it should be slightly upturned at the opening to catch gas as it backs up 2  the diameter of the nozzle should be larger and it easily could be given the tank inlet size   would allow faster filling. the size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. the funnel is 10  long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6  long. it states that the funnel is 4  x 4  but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2 1 4  in diameter at the widest point.it would work to put a quart container of a liquid into something but for any larger container it is going to be worthless.\""
